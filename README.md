# Smart Retail Intelligence and Forecasting System

This project is a smart data system designed to analyze retail sales data and provide predictive and advanced analytics through a web-based dashboard. It was developed as part of my **Master's degree project** in Information Technology Management.

## üîç What It Does
- Collects and preprocesses retail sales data
- Visualizes key metrics like average sales, outlet distribution, and item prices
- Provides **Advanced Insights** such as feature importance, category breakdowns, and price-to-sales relationships
- Forecasts future sales using time-series models
- Predicts sales using machine learning for individual or batch entries
- Exports summary reports as PDF or Excel

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Built It
- Built an end-to-end pipeline using **Python** and **Streamlit** for the frontend UI
- Used **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning and feature engineering
- Designed custom **Plotly** visualizations for interactive charts
- Implemented **Ridge Regression** as the core ML model for accurate sales prediction
- Integrated **Advanced Analytics** modules to explore product performance, price sensitivity, and outlet comparisons
- Added **time-series forecasting** to analyze sales trends over time
- Developed a report generation module using **FPDF** to export analysis in PDF

Everything is packaged in a clean dashboard with separate tabs for Overview, Advanced Insights, Prediction, and Report Export.

## üì¶ Tools & Libraries
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (Ridge Regression)
- Plotly
- Pandas & NumPy
- FPDF for reporting

## üéØ Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate the implementation of a retail smart data system that integrates analytics, forecasting, advanced insights, and reporting into a unified interface. It also fulfills the requirements of my academic Master's project in IT Management.
